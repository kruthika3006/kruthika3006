# üë©‚Äçüíª About Me

Hello! I'm Kruthika, a fresher and aspiring Data Analyst with a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization. I recently completed a Data Science Bootcamp, where I built several hands-on projects using real-world business scenarios.

I‚Äôve worked extensively with:
- SQL for data querying and analysis
- Python for data manipulation and visualization
- Excel for interactive dashboards and analysis
- Power BI for business intelligence and storytelling
- Machine Learning for predictive analytics

I'm passionate about uncovering insights from data and translating them into actionable strategies.
